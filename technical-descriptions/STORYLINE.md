# Level 1:
The game will start in the Ashikaga Shogunate Ruins and the protagonist will learn the basic commands of the game. He will learn how to Move `(A and D)`, how to Jump `(W or Spacebar)` and how to Attack `(left mouse button)`, facing his first enemy: a katanaji. Afterwards he will find two more katanajis and, when he defeats them, there will be a lake of fire. It will take a Double Jump `(W + W)` to cross it. Soon after, a katanaji will appear on the left and, on the right, a katanaji and a tanegashimiri. Finally, he will meet up with Onigama and the two will start fighting. To dodge the boss's attacks, the player will learn Dash `(right mouse button)`. After being hit six times, Onigama can no longer be attacked and the level will end. The player will unlock the Falling Attack skill `(S)` and depart for Yawarakai Mori.

# Level 2:
Upon arriving at Yawarakai Mori, the protagonist will find three katanajis and two tanegashimiris. Upon defeating them, the player will have to survive some traps (saws and wooden logs) and reach the last challenge of the stage: an ambush where there will be a trap on each side of the screen and seven more enemies (two katanajis and a tanegashimiri on each side, but a kunaja will appears when only one enemy remains among the first six). After that, the level ends, the player unlocks the Specific Attack skill `(press right mouse button for 3s)` and proceeds to the second part of Yawarakai Mori.
