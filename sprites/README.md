# Sprites
This directory was created to document the work of the Graphic Design and Structural Design for our UxO Beta game.

## What are sprites?
Sprites are graphic elements or two-dimensional images used in video games, animations and computer graphics. They represent characters, objects, settings, items, visual effects and other visible elements in a virtual environment or game.

The main characteristic of sprites is their ability to be moved independently of other graphic elements on the screen. They are often used to create animations, especially in retro and 2D games, where each frame of the animation is represented by a different sprite. Sprites are also used to save processing resources, as they can be rendered and manipulated more efficiently than larger bitmap images.

Sprites can vary in complexity and size, from simple static objects to detailed, animated characters. Additionally, in more advanced 3D games, sprites can be used for visual effects such as particles, sparks, or explosions.

In summary, sprites are essential components for creating graphics and visual interactions in games and interactive applications, making them a fundamental part of the development of digital games and animations.

## Category
The sprites are divided into four areas: _[Bosses](./bosses/)_, _[Characters](./characters/)_, _[Enemies](./enemies/)_ and _[General](./general/)_.

Within each directory there are the sprites of each specific character in the game, with the exception of the directory with the game's general sprites (_[General](./general/)_). Within each directory there is also a _markdown_ file covering the character and/or item.

Now I will do a quick explanation of each directory.

-------------------------
### [General](./general/)
- This directory has the general sprites of the game, that is, the sprites of houses, clouds, etc. This directory is divided into phases.

- Directory: [general](./general/)

- Item definition: 
    - [Level 1 README](./general/sprites_general/level1/README.md)
    - [Level 2 README](./general/sprites_general/level2/README.md)

-------------------------------
### [Characters](./characters/)
- In this directory are the sprites of the protagonists. They will face all the challenges of UxO Beta.

- Directory: [characters](./characters/)

- Description of characters:
