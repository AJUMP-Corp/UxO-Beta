# Sounds Effects
This directory was created to document the work of the Sound Engineer for our UxO Beta game.

## Why Sound Effects?
Sound effects in games play a key role in creating an immersive and unforgettable experience. They elevate player immersion by adding realism, providing feedback, and communicating important information.

For example, the sound of a sword cutting through the air or hitting an enemy in a game provides instant feedback of the player's actions in the game. This not only makes the gaming experience more rewarding, but also helps the player better understand what's going on in the game.

In addition, sound effects can help establish the tone and ambience of the game. For example, the sound of a sword being drawn can create a sense of tension or anticipation. Similarly, the sound of a sword cutting through the air can give the player a sense of power and control.

In summary, sound effects in games are an important tool to increase immersion, provide feedback to the player, and help establish the atmosphere of the game.

## Effects
The sound effects are divided into four areas: _[Bosses](./bosses/)_, _[Characters](./characters/)_, _[Enemies](./enemies/)_ and _[General](./general/)_.

Within each directory there are the sounds of each specific character in the game, with the exception of the directory with the general sounds of the game (_[General](./general/)_). Within each directory there is also a _markdown_ file explaining the process of building each sound effect.

Now I will do a quick explanation of each directory.

-------------------------
### [General](./general/)
- This directory has the general sounds of the game, but... what does that mean? These are effects that every protagonist or character can use within the game.

- Directory: [general](./general/)

- Effects construction: [General README](./general/README.md)

-------------------------------
### [Characters](./characters/)
- In this directory are the sound effects of the protagonists. They will face all the challenges of UxO Beta.

- Directory: [characters](./characters/)

- Effects construction: 
    - [Utuh README](./characters/utuh/README.md)
    - [Ayumi README](./characters/ayumi/README.md)

-----------------------
### [Bosses](./bosses/)

-------------------------
### [Enemies](./enemies/)
