## Ayumi's Attack
This effect was done using the voice of a girl, the sound effect represents the sound made by Ayumi when deferring an attack. This effect conveys a sense of effort and dedication on the part of our protagonist Ayumi.

The sounds of blows in games help convey the sense of impact and strength of the attacks, increasing the player's immersion in the gaming experience. In addition, they can provide important feedback to the player about the success or failure of their attacks, helping them make strategic decisions during the game.

The attack sound effects of Utuh are divided into three variations, to make the experience more dynamic.
