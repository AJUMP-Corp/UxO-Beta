# Utuh Sounds Effects
We will show here how the construction of the sound effects of the protagonist Utuh of the game UxO Beta was done.

## Utuh's Attack
This effect was done using the voice of the Sound Engineer, the sound effect represents the sound made by Utuh when deferring an attack. This effect conveys a sense of effort and dedication on the part of our protagonist Utuh.

The sounds of blows in games help convey the sense of impact and strength of the attacks, increasing the player's immersion in the gaming experience. In addition, they can provide important feedback to the player about the success or failure of their attacks, helping them make strategic decisions during the game.

The attack sound effects of Utuh are divided into three variations, to make the experience more dynamic.

## Utuh's Sword 1
This effect represents Utuh's standard sword. It will accompany Utuh at the beginning of his journey, which makes it very special. More than a sword, it is a Katana. "The katana was much more than a weapon for a samurai, it was practically his soul, spirituality, essence and values."

This sound was made with two meat cleavers. The effect in the photo below is effect 1. I used four different sword sounds to make this effect. The idea is a more solid sound to make the base. Two medium sounds to make the second base and the sharpest and most open sound that will give the effect its beauty.

## Utuh's Sound 2
I made this sound by passing the cleavers through each other, to give the impression of a cut. And also the stronger impression of the clash of swords.

The sound of swords cutting in games is a crucial element for player immersion. It helps to create a more realistic and immersive experience, increasing player satisfaction.

## Utuh's Sound 3
I used some of the sounds from the previous effect to create this third effect. For this effect I shook the cleavers very quickly as if they were shaking hands after the impact of the two swords.
