# Sounds Effects
This directory was created to document the work of the Sound Engineer for our UxO Beta game.

## Why Sound Effects?
Sound effects in games play a key role in creating an immersive and unforgettable experience. They elevate player immersion by adding realism, providing feedback, and communicating important information.

For example, the sound of a sword cutting through the air or hitting an enemy in a game provides instant feedback of the player's actions in the game. This not only makes the gaming experience more rewarding, but also helps the player better understand what's going on in the game.

In addition, sound effects can help establish the tone and ambiance of the game. For example, the sound of a sword being drawn can create a sense of tension or anticipation. Similarly, the sound of a sword cutting through the air can give the player a sense of power and control.

In summary, sound effects in games are an important tool to increase immersion, provide feedback to the player, and help establish the atmosphere of the game.

## Effects
The sound effects are divided into 4 (four): *[Bosses](sounds/bosses)*, *[Characters](sounds/characters/)*, *[Enemies](sounds/enemies/)* and *[General](sounds/general/)*.

Within each directory there are the sounds of each specific character in the game, with the exception of the directory with the general sounds of the game(*[General](sounds/general/)*). Within each directory there is also a *markdown* file explaining the process of building each sound effect.

Now I'll do a quick explanation of each directory.
 
### [General](sounds/general/)
This directory has the general sounds of the game, what does that mean? These are effects that every protagonist can use or any other character within the game.

Directory: [general](sounds/general/)
