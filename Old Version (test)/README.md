# Exploring the Evolution of Our Initial Ideas

In this section, we provide a glimpse into the earlier stages of our project's development. Here, you will find various components from our initial ideas, which, although we ultimately decided not to incorporate into the final product due to production challenges, still hold historical significance in our creative journey.

## Legacy Sprites
To begin with, we have a collection of [sprites](https://github.com/AJUMP-Corp/UxO-Beta/tree/main/Old%20Version%20(test)/Sprites%20(Pixel%20Art)) that once served as the foundation for our vision. These sprites, though no longer in use, offer a fascinating insight into the artistic direction we initially explored.

## Outdated Tiles
Furthermore, we present the old [tiles](https://github.com/AJUMP-Corp/UxO-Beta/tree/main/Old%20Version%20(test)/Tiles%20(Level%201)) from the initial phase of the game's development. These tiles, crafted with care, represent the early stages of our level design, which has since evolved into something more refined.

## Pre-Alpha Executable
For those curious about the early gameplay experience, we offer the [executable](https://github.com/AJUMP-Corp/UxO-Beta/tree/main/Old%20Version%20(test)/Unity%20Game%20Executable%20(Pre-Alpha%20Version)) of the game in its Pre-Alpha version. This build, although outdated, showcases the fundamental mechanics and gameplay concepts we explored during the project's infancy.

## Testing the Past
Last but not least, we invite you to explore the [test](https://github.com/AJUMP-Corp/UxO-Beta/tree/main/Old%20Version%20(test)/Unity%20Game%20Project%20(Pixel%20Art%20Test)) we conducted using the original sprites and tiles. This test represents a significant milestone in our development process, helping us refine our ideas and move closer to our final vision.

While these elements may no longer be part of the current project, they serve as a testament to our dedication and creative exploration. Feel free to dive into the past and witness the evolution of our ideas, from humble beginnings to where we are today.
